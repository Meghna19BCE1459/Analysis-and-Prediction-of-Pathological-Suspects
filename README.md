Problem Statement:
To conduct heart disease data analysis and also build a classification and regression tree using cardiotocographic data and to classify patients as pathological and non-pathological suspects of heart diseases.

Abstract:
With the new and sedentary lifestyle which a large majority of the population across the world is being exposed to, there has been a significant increase in heart diseases like those of heart failure, pericardial diseases, heart stroke etc. In order to analyze and portray the severity of this issue, we have decided to conduct heart disease data analysis and also build a classification and regression tree using cardiotocographic data using essential parameters like fasting blood sugar, serum cholesterol, max heart rate, etc. 
Through this analysis, we will be able to identify if a person is prone to have a heart disease or not using logistic regression for gaining accurate and precise results. Apart from this, we will also be curating a decision tree using classification and regression to classify patients as pathological and non-pathological suspects of heart diseases. 
The motive behind choosing this problem statement for data analysis is to create awareness on the severity of heart diseases today and also provide a substantial solution in predicting if a person is likely to have a heart ailment or not.
